# CarReviewAPI

This is a simple ASP.NET CORE Web Api with SwaggerUI based on the model below.

This project contains 5 models, CRUD operations for each one of them, code-first approach, SQL.

While doing this project I tried to use Github to the fullest with test issues, pr, branches and merges.

After opening the folder in the VS:
-You are gonna have to edit the connection string in appsettings.json
-Delete the Migrations Folder
-Type "Add-Migration InitialCreate" then "Update-Database in PM Console
and you are good to go.
